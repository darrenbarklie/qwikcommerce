# QwikCommerce

## Premise

2022-10-24

Within the development community there is increasing desire for reduced
loading and rendering times than what is offered by client side rendered 
frameworks such as React, Vue and Angular. 

The consensus the open source community is reaching is to simply send less
JavaScript to the client browser. Maturing frameworks that are actualising 
solutions to meet this demand include [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/),
[Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/) and [Astro](https://astro.build/).

They take different approaches to solve the same problem; sending less
JavaScript to load faster.

Catching [this stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa6-Mn0Eybg&t=2s&ab_channel=Theo-ping%E2%80%A4gg)
between Theo Browne and Misko Hevery live left me convinced that there is a
market opportunity for faster, performant, ecommerce platform.

This might take the format of a SaaS platform, with the pitch of being faster
than all others, with a collaborative production process
(like [builder.io](https://builder.io/). Alternatively, we build out a
convincing demo to pitch our services as an agency offering; helping
established ecommerce players transfer their stack by optimising with Qwik.
